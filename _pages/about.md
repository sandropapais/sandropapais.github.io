Ph.D. Candidate at University of Toronto [Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/).

Robotic perception researcher with 7 years of robotics R&D experience. My work focuses on robotic perception, leveraging 3D computer vision and machine learning to understand dynamic environments. My research aims to push the boundaries of how robots perceive, interpret, and interact with the world around them.

## Research Interests

- **3D Computer Vision**: Multi-object tracking, object detection, and scene understanding
- **Sensor Fusion**: LiDAR, camera, and radar integration for autonomous systems  
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning applications for robotic perception
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Perception systems for self-driving cars
- **Real-time Systems**: Efficient algorithms for dynamic environment understanding

## Current Research

My current research focuses on developing robust perception systems that enable robots to navigate and understand complex, dynamic environments. I work on multi-modal sensor fusion techniques, combining data from cameras, LiDAR, and radar to create comprehensive environmental representations.

## Background

I hold extensive experience in robotics R&D, with particular expertise in computer vision algorithms, sensor fusion, and machine learning applications for autonomous systems. My work spans from fundamental research in perception algorithms to practical implementations in real-world robotic systems.
