Hello! I’m Sandro Papais, a Ph.D. Candidate at the [University of Toronto Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (UTIAS)](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/steven-waslander/). I’m also an Affiliate Researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and a Machine Learning Perception Researcher at [Zoox](https://zoox.com/)**, where I work on advancing perception systems for autonomous driving.  

Before my Ph.D., I developed visual navigation and autonomy software for interplanetary spacecraft at [NASA JPL, Mobility and Robotics Group](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/), lunar landers and eVTOLs at [NGC Aerospace](https://ngcaerospace.com/en/), and rovers at European Space Agency, Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC).

My research lies at the intersection of 3D computer vision, machine learning, robotic perception, and motion forecasting, with a focus on **spatiotemporal world models** and **end-to-end autonomous driving models** that enable robots to perceive and act safely in dynamic environments.

Recently, I’ve been developing **camera and lidar-based temporal perception systems** that improve temporal reasoning in autonomous vehicles, allowing them to maintain object awareness through occlusions and reason about motion and object permanence. I’m the first author of **ForeSight (ICCV 2025)**, a multi-view streaming transformer for joint 3D detection and forecasting, and **SWTrack (ICRA 2024)**, a multiple-hypothesis tracking framework for autonomous driving. These works aim to bridge the gap between static perception and dynamic reasoning in robotic systems.  

I’m always open to discussing research, collaborations, or new ideas — feel free to reach out!
