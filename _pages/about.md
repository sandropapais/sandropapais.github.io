Hello! I’m **Sandro Papais**, a Ph.D. Candidate at the [University of Toronto Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (UTIAS)](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/steven-waslander/). I’m also an Affiliate Researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and a Machine Learning Perception Researcher at [Zoox](https://zoox.com/), where I work on advancing perception systems for autonomous driving. I co-developed the [Self-Driving Cars Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars) on Coursera, a MOOC that has reached over 120,000 learners worldwide.

Before my Ph.D., I developed visual navigation and autonomy software for interplanetary spacecraft at [NASA JPL’s Mobility and Robotics Group](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/), lunar landers and eVTOLs at [NGC Aerospace](https://ngcaerospace.com/en/), and rovers at the [European Space Agency’s Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC)](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/ESTEC).

My work has been recognized by awards including the [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2025-north-america), the [Ontario Graduate Scholarship](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019245.html), [first place at AutoDrive Challenge II](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/news/u-of-ts-self-driving-car-team-places-first-at-2024-autodrive-challenge-ii/), and [first place at the Spaceport America Genesis Cup](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/article/mcgill-rocket-team-soars-first-place-spaceport-america-cup). My research has been published in top venues in robotics and computer vision, including a forthcoming book on [motion forecasting for robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09074), and was featured by [U of T News](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/news/u-of-t-engineering-researchers-are-making-self-driving-cars-safer-by-enhancing-tracking-abilities/) for advancing tracking in self-driving cars.

I’ll be graduating in **September 2026** and am currently exploring new opportunities. I’m always open to discussing research, collaborations, or ideas—feel free to [reach out](mailto:sandro.papais@robotics.utias.utoronto.ca)!

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, **3D perception**, and **motion forecasting**, with a focus on **spatiotemporal world models** and **end-to-end autonomous driving architectures** that enable robots to perceive and act safely in dynamic environments.

Recently, I’ve been developing **camera- and LiDAR-based temporal perception systems** that enhance an autonomous vehicle’s ability to reason over time, maintaining object awareness through occlusions and modeling motion and object permanence. I’m the first author of **ForeSight (ICCV 2025)**, a multi-view streaming transformer for joint 3D detection and forecasting, and **SWTrack (ICRA 2024)**, a multiple-hypothesis tracking framework for autonomous driving. These works aim to bridge the gap between static perception and dynamic reasoning in robotic systems.
