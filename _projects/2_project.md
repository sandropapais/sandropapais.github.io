## Camera-LiDAR 3D Object Tracking

This project implements a comprehensive 3D object tracking system that leverages both camera images and LiDAR point clouds for enhanced robustness and accuracy in autonomous vehicle applications.

### Overview

The fusion of camera and LiDAR sensors provides complementary information:
- **Camera**: Rich semantic information, texture, and appearance details
- **LiDAR**: Accurate 3D spatial information and distance measurements

### Key Components

1. **Sensor Calibration**: Precise calibration between camera and LiDAR coordinate systems
2. **Object Detection**: Deep learning-based detection in both camera and LiDAR domains
3. **Data Association**: Intelligent matching of detections across sensor modalities
4. **Tracking Algorithm**: Kalman filter-based tracking with multi-modal state estimation

### Technical Implementation

The system processes synchronized camera and LiDAR data streams:

```cpp
// Pseudo-code for sensor fusion pipeline
void processSensorData(CameraFrame& camera, LiDARPointCloud& lidar) {
    auto camera_detections = detectObjects(camera);
    auto lidar_detections = detectObjects(lidar);
    
    auto fused_detections = fuseDetections(camera_detections, lidar_detections);
    updateTracks(fused_detections);
}
```

### Results

The sensor fusion approach demonstrates improved tracking accuracy and robustness compared to single-sensor systems, particularly in challenging weather conditions and complex urban environments.
